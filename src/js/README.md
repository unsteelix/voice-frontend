## Before Your Start Coding

This Boilerplate is providing a infrastructure to start your project as quickly as you can.

__BUT__ before you start developing a real large scale project, please do ask yourself or your team a few questions :-

* What is your domain layer looks like ? You can pretend redux as a data repository of everything, but it will provide no actual meaning for your application besides a data bag.  For example, am I able to describe what a `User` is in the application. Having a domain layer will help yourself from having heart attack of arbitrary data structure that describe the same thing in different places.
* I know you are a smart engineer, but please remember it is better to write code everyone can understand.
* You only need to solve a problem when you have a real problem, don't prematurely making a decision based on preference.
* Strong convention is better for everyone, if you don't have convention today, you will have N+1 conventions the next month.
